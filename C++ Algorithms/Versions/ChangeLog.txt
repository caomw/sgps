Version 1.6.1
------------------------
	-- Fitting is erased.
	-- Only EqT is taken into account. The results are good.
	-- This is the version which should be used.
	-- IMPORTANT: In order to compare results when building the new C++ version, the measures used
			are the ones which are in the Javi Laptop "Research/LIB System - Not in Dropbox" folder.

	-- This version deprecates all the others and also: 1.6.2 (with fitting and EqT) and 1.6.3 (without ant correction).

Version 1.6
------------------------
	-- Fixed getSS and getSR procedures. 
		- Now work fine when there are more than two transitions.
		- Add return -1 when it dont find SS or SR value correctly.
	-- Add new output file that contains files with error -1 (returned in getSS or getSS)
	

Version 1.5
------------------------
	-- Fixed error on getSS and getSR procedures. index of vectors had many errors.
	-- Rebuild time window on getSS and getSR procedures. Thit is used when there are more than two transitions only.
	-- Add output file that contains the longitude and latitude error percent.
	-- getSS and getSR functions analyze the data using binary subdivision.

Version 1.4.1
-------------------------
	-- Modify output data orderer. Now the file also has:
		· Error latitude
		· Error longitude
		· Error latitude  (%)
		· Error longitude (%)

Version 1.4
-------------------------
	-- Fixed data reading: skipping files which have any measure erro flag at 1.
	-- Add the way where NOAA calculate the longitude error (no se como poner esto^^)
	-- Remove table added in 1.2 version.
	-- Improved the time window.

Version 1.3 (original name: LLFfixedadding 12 Last (Improved))
-------------------------
	-- Files with more than 2 transitions are readed (I think this is not the change
	   in this file)



Version 1.2 (original name: LLFfixedadding 12 Table)
-------------------------
	-- Add a table which contains the error of longitude for each day of the year. 
	   This error is constant for each year at any place.
	-- Transitions are studied using a time window.


Version 1.1.2 (original name: LLFfixedadding 12)
-------------------------
	-- Add 12 hours at midday using the SR and SS times of the same day.
		(approximation told in the paper).


Version 1.1 (original name: LLFfixed)
-------------------------
	-- Remplacement of short latitude formula by long latitude formula.
	

Version 1.0 (original name: SLF)
--------------
	- Applies short latitude formula.
	- Uses files with only 2 transitions.
	- In fractionated days open the previous day to get the SR.
